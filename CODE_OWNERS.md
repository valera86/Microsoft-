The following is a list of owners for different areas of the Terminal code.
Each of the owners is responsible for ensuring that changes in their areas
are reviewed, either by themselves or by someone they designate, in
addition to being the final word for the architecture and content of an area.

Note: If you don't find the area in the below list, or you have a general
question, send a message to Dustin Howett (@dhowett) and Mike Griese
(@zadjii-msft). They can ensure that the question gets forwarded to the
right person or answer it themselves.
