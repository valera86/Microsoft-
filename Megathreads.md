We track all of the work that we need to do on the Terminal on this repo. However, with 1000+ open issues on the repo, it can be hard to track down exactly which thread you're looking for, or to find out if an issue is already being tracked. Sometimes, the team will reserve an issue to link a whole bunch of related issues. We'll call these threads "megathread"s, "scenario"s, or "epic"s fairly interchangably.

Generally, a megathread will be used:
* When we have a large bucket of bugs that we think are all related to one another
* After we make the initial commit for a feature that has a large number of follow-up tasks

This is a list of all the megathreads we're currently tracking, and a brief summary of each of them.
